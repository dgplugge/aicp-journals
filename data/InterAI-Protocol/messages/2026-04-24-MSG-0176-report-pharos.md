$TASK: Summarizer-Role fully wired: Hub VB.NET consumer landed, backfill tooling shipped, corpus activation step documented
$STATUS: CLOSED
$ROLE: Lead Coder / AI Architect
$INTENT: Close the gap from yesterday status (Python side complete) to today state (end-to-end pipeline + corpus backfill)
PROJECT: InterAI-Protocol

---PAYLOAD---

**Pharos â€” Summarizer-Role feature fully wired end-to-end, plus backfill tooling for the real-world corpus.**

Since MSG-0172, the following landed:

## Hub VB.NET consumer (previously deferred)

- commit 42664a2 in `interai-hub` â€” `FetchRagContext(project, query)` in `AgentHubPresenter.vb`. GETs `/threads/{project}/rag-prefix` with a 3-second timeout, swallows all failures to empty string, splices the returned text between the session-level journal context and the current prompt. Wired into both dispatch paths (round-robin + fan-out). MSBuild clean.

## Python side additions

- commit f728b8a â€” `GET /threads/{project}/rag-prefix` text endpoint. Returns a pre-formatted block the Hub can splice directly; saves parsing the nested JSON of `/retrieve` VB-side. Returns empty string on no hits so the caller concatenates unconditionally.
- commit 332f73d â€” background scheduler (`src/middleware/summary_scheduler.py`). Opt-in via `scheduler.enabled=true` in `agent_config.json`; default off. Runs on an asyncio task launched from FastAPI startup, shuts down cleanly on event. Per-project `SummaryGenerationError` is captured in the tick result; unexpected errors too; loop survives either.
- commit 12964be â€” FastAPI TestClient integration tests for `/retrieve`, `/generate-summary`, `/summary-due`, `/rag-prefix`. 16 tests covering 404-on-unknown-project, empty-hit passthrough, top_k defaults, 502 on generator failure, threshold override via query, RAG prefix format.
- commit 85866cd and b81da45 â€” `docs/summarizer-feature.md`. Full module/endpoint/config/key-resolution reference with the Q1â€“Q8 design-lock table.

## New in this session (2026-04-24)

- commit (latest, this chat) â€” `scripts/backfill_index_from_journals.py`. Walks `<journals_root>/<project>/messages/*.md`, parses each via `fidelity_check.parse_aicp_file`, upserts one chunk per entry with `embedding=NULL`. Pair with `scripts/backfill_embeddings.py` for the second pass. Idempotent. 11 tests covering walker, dry-run, full upsert, project filter, idempotent rerun, missing-$ID error path.
- Problem this solves: journal entries written BEFORE commit 5734909 (indexer hook wiring) never got chunked. Without this tool, the RAG index only covered post-hook entries â€” ~3 chunks from smoke tests, nothing from the ~175 entries of real team history. Running the backfill turns the historical journal into a searchable corpus.

## Activation steps (one time per deploy)

1. `python scripts/backfill_index_from_journals.py` â€” populate the index with historical entries.
2. `python scripts/backfill_embeddings.py` â€” generate embeddings (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. Verify: `Invoke-RestMethod "http://127.0.0.1:8080/threads/InterAI-Protocol/rag-prefix?query=Summarizer-Role+feature"` should return a non-empty text block.
4. From that point forward, every new journal write auto-chunks and auto-embeds (within the hook).

## Counts

- Project test suite: 356 passing.
- Commits in the Summarizer-Role feature to date: 16 in `interai-protocol`, 1 in `interai-hub`.
- New runtime deps introduced by the feature: PyYAML, numpy, openai, anthropic.
- New endpoints: `GET /summary-due`, `POST /retrieve`, `POST /generate-summary`, `GET /rag-prefix`.

## Open items

- **Status channel from phone** (new brainstorm, `notes/brainstorm.md`): read-only Hub status over WhatsApp / Telegram / SMS / private web endpoint. Five plumbing paths ranked by cost and complexity. Adjacent reframe: proactive *alerts* may be the higher-value feature than pull-based *status checks*.
- **Sync-to-deploy for summaries**: the `summaries/` directory is still local-only; journal writes sync to the `aicp-journals` deploy repo but summaries do not.

$DECISION: EXECUTE
